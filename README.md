# Aftab Khan's Resume

This repo is going to be powering the resume for Aftab Khan. There has been a fair amount of procrastination that has gone into starting this. But finally it has been decided that we are going to be trying a couple of things out for this one. Initially the scope had a lot of things to be done. But for the sake of sanity & "Atomic Habits", we are going to start with the following
* We are trying our Vite 3 for the first time
* We are going to use [React PDF](https://react-pdf.org/) which is promising both Web view & PDF download capability
* Let's hope this helps "Catch the eye" easily :)
